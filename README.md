PROJECT TITLE:
PERDICTING HEART DISEASE IN PATIENTS.

ABOUT DATASET AND PROJECT:
The dataset used for this task comes from various publicly available sources, including the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which includes several medical attributes associated with heart disease.


Heart disease prediction has been a widely researched area in medical and computational sciences. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical assessment and scoring systems, but machine learning (ML) has gained attention for its ability to analyze large datasets and improve predictive accuracy. This review explores existing studies on heart disease severity prediction, focusing on four key ML models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Linear Regression.
